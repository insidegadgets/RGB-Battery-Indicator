Add an RGB battery indicator to any device you like to monitor the battery level.
Default firmware is for a LiPo.

Order the board at 0.8mm thickness if installing in Gameboy. Likely some shell cutting will be required.
You'll need a programmer like a USBasp.
Check the picture for the parts placement.
Not recommended for beginners.
